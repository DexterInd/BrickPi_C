BrickPi C Code

In this repository we've placed a C library for BrickPi

BrickPi is a Raspberry Pi Board that connects LEGO MINDSTORMS motors and sensors to the Raspberry Pi.

BrickPi.h is the most important file here; it is the key to everything else.  Examples are given under "Sensor Examples" for using the different sensors.

More information on hardware, firmware, and software can be found here:  http://www.dexterindustries.com/BrickPi
